                answer: "Executing Agent",
                feedback: "This is a great example of an Executing Agent. It not only needs to reason about the data but also execute real-world actions like sending out quote requests via email or a procurement system, which is a key characteristic of this type of agent."

                feedback: "A Reasoning-Based Agent is the best fit. The agent must use its reasoning abilities to read, understand, and synthesize information from a large corpus of scientific papers to identify and present relevant new findings, which is a complex reasoning task."
